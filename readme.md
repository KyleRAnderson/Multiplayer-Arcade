## Multiplayer Pong Arcade

A peer-to-peer multiplayer implementation of the classic game of pong! Included three game modes:
- Local multiplayer: Players right next to each other use the same keyboard.
- Local singleplayer: A player chooses to compete against a bot of a difficulty they select - Easy, Intermediate or Hard.
- Online multiplayer: Two players connect to each other on the same local network and play the game of pong on their machines.

This is the final project for Nicolas Hawrysh and Kyle Anderson in the grade 12 ICS4U course.
